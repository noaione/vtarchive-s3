# NextJS Template

This is a simple template that I'll use to generate new NextJS project easily without needing to copy paste stuff from other projects of mine.

Using:
- ðŸŽ¨ Tailwind CSS + PostCSS with some plugin
- ðŸ’ª Strong typing support with **TypeScript**
- ðŸ’» Linting support with **ESLint** + **Prettier** for making the code much more beautiful
- ðŸš€ Fast compilation with ESBuild

The template is setup so you can just start working without needing to worry much about your setup.

**PostCSS are configured**:<br />
Default NextJS config with:
- CSS Nesting support
- CSS import support
- CSS minifier with cssnano

**Tailwind are configured**:<br />
- JIT mode
- Purging on `componenets`, `lib`, and `pages`
- Using class for dark mode (meaning changing the html class)
- Using a True Gray version for Gray color
- No extra plugins setup, you do it yourself.

**NextJS and Babel are configured**:<br />
- Using `babel-plugin-typescript-to-proptypes` plugin to automatically convert Interface to PropTypes
- Using 'esbuild-loader` to make build faster (also replaced Terser with esbuild-loader).
- Webpack 5

This project is bootstrapped with yarn, but you can use other package manager. The reason why I use yarn is because vercel deployment support.
